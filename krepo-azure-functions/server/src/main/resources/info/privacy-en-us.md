Since this software is currently only for your personal use, there are limited personal data collection and processing
practices.

### Information We Collect

- **Unauthenticated Users**: No personal information is collected from unauthenticated users.
- **Authenticated Users**: Since there are no user accounts or registration features, no personal data is stored or
  processed.

### Use of Your Data

As there is no personal data collection or storage for users, we do not use, share, or process personal data in any way.
However, any data you store on the system may be processed on your behalf solely for the purpose of running the
application.

### Data Processing Location

Some data or files may be processed outside of mainland China, but since no personal information is stored, this will
not affect user privacy.

### Your Rights

As there is no personal data stored or processed, the right to access, modify, or delete data does not apply.
